Fun With Node.js workshop

## Tasks:
Either build a real-time chat app or an image-host. Both come with failing tests you will need to make pass. Read the readmes in the `chat` or `image-host` directories for more information.
If you feel brave or bored there is a third option, the P2P todo list. You will need to make your own tests for this one. Check out the readme in the `peertodos` directory for more.
