# Peer Todos
P2P todo list using [CRDT](https://github.com/dominictarr/crdt) to replicate an ordered todo list across servers(maybe even browsers).

This task is for the brave so there are no tests. You'll have to write them yourself if you want, or just skip them.

## Todo
✗ Tests  
✗ Todo list  
✗ P2P replication between servers
